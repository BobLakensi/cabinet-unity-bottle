It challenged the traditional ways of depicting art, but some artists welcomed it. Photography challenged painting. Photography was also used in paint as ways to render the images in the painting or a cheaper and faster way to reproduce the painting. During this time, artistic patronage shifter from the elite few to a broader range of people. It was soon used to influence modern life and changes to communication and information management.
