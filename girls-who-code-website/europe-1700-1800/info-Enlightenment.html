                        <p class = "mainText"> Rationality and critical thinking based on logic and science instead of faith became the core Enlightenment ideas. The Enlightenment stemmed from many ideas from the Scientific Revolution. Isaac Newton developed the scientific method and encouraged others to avoid metaphysics and the supernatural. This emphasis on tangible data and concrete experience became a major idea of the Enlightenment. Diderot organized the first encyclopedia, a book containing all human knowledge. Galileo developed the heliocentric theories and made advances in astronomy. Science became included in art, as seen in the realism and detail, natural landscape, focus on accurate anatomy, and the light of God being replaced by the light of science. Iron and the machine were improved upon, causing an increase in architecture and mass production.
